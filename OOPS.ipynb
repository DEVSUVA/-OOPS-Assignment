        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "ANS> OOP is a way of programming based on objects that contain both data and functions. It helps organize code into reusable parts and makes complex programs easier to manage.\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "ANS> A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the data and behavior that the objects of that type will have.\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "ANS> An object is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity and contains its own data and functions.\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "ANS> Abstraction hides complex details and shows only what's necessary. Encapsulation binds data and methods together while restricting direct access to some parts of the code.\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "ANS> Dunder (double underscore) methods like __init__ or __str__ are special methods that define how objects behave in certain situations. They make objects work with built-in operations like print() or +.\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "ANS> Inheritance allows one class to use the properties and methods of another. The new class (child) can extend or modify the features of the existing one (parent).\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "ANS> Polymorphism allows methods with the same name to behave differently depending on the object calling them.\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "ANS> Encapsulation is done by using private and protected variables. A single or double underscore before a variable name restricts access to it from outside the class.\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "ANS> A constructor is the __init__ method that runs automatically when an object is created. It initializes the object's attributes.\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "ANS> A class method works with the class itself and is marked with @classmethod. A static method is defined with @staticmethod and doesn't depend on class or object data.\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "ANS> Python doesn't support traditional overloading. Instead, it handles multiple argument cases using default arguments or *args and **kwargs.\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "ANS> Method overriding happens when a subclass defines a method with the same name as one in its parent class but changes its behavior.\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "ANS> @property makes a method act like an attribute. It's used to control how class data is accessed or modified.\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "ANS> It makes code flexible and allows different object types to be used with the same function or method call.\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "ANS> An abstract class is a class that can't be directly created. It defines methods that must be implemented in its subclasses. It's made using the ABC module.\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "ANS> OOP improves code reusability, organization, and readability. It also makes maintenance and debugging easier.\n",
        "17. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "ANS> Multiple inheritance lets a class inherit from more than one parent class. It can combine features but may cause method conflicts.\n",
        "18. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "ANS> A class variable is shared by all objects of a class, while an instance variable belongs to one specific object.\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of '__str__' and '__repr__' methods in Python.?\n",
        "ANS> __str__ defines how an object is shown when printed. __repr__ is used for a developer-readable version, often for debugging.\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the 'super()' function in Python?\n",
        "ANS> super() is used to call methods of the parent class. It helps extend the parent's behavior without rewriting it.\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "ANS> __del__ is the destructor method. It's called when an object is deleted and is often used for cleanup tasks.\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "ANS> @classmethod takes the class as its first argument and can modify class-level data. @staticmethod doesn't take self or cls and behaves like a regular function inside the class.\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "ANS>  When a child class overrides a method, Python decides which method to call at runtime based on the object type. This is runtime polymorphism.\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "ANS> Method chaining means calling several methods in one line. Each method returns self so the next one can be called immediately.\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "ANS> __call__ lets an object be used like a function. When you call obj(), Python executes obj.__call__().\n"
